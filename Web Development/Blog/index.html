                        Hello, my name is Rhys and I have been teaching myself to program for about a year. In that time I have taken breaks or have gotten myself in tutorial hell. 
                        This has led me to the decision to create The Project Programmer; a blog to document the creation of new projects. I have personally decided that I want to start off
                        with web development as this is what I am currently learning.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Just to give you a small background into me (if anyone ever reads). I am a 23 year old university student currently studying Creative Computing at Bath Spa. However
                        I originally started off studying Music Technology which although was a very good course. I felt like my motivation for music wasn't there. I had just had a son 
                        (the pride of my life), suffering the dreaded imposter syndrome and I was worried I would never be able to help to support my family.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Luckily I had purchased a book a while before which was called Python for Dummies which I finally got round to giving it a try and I then just knew that 
                        programming was for me. Quickly I moved on to trying some free youtube courses in which I learned a little about pythons turtle library and created a small game using pygame.
                        However as much as I tried I didn't fully grasp everything at this time and was unnable to produce an original game myself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This carried on for a while until I discovered codecademy where I did an awful lot of courses but didn't build much myself. However I studied and solved a lot of 
                        small programming problems. This did help me to get better. However I then started uni and had to build projects of my own> This is where I really threw myself into
                        the work and built a really solid foundation in C++. I did every problem I was set and extended some even further. This culminated in a small project to build a simple 
                        vending machine app. However I pushed myself to learn classes and add a database into my app which really pushed my skills and self learning much further.

                    <p>
                        Now I am learning Web Development and really just the HTML and CSS basics. I wanted to push myself into creating more projects in order to push my skills. 
                        I do see the irony that I have chosen to create a blog as my first project. But I do feel that if I document my projects I might be helping someone else to learn
                        a new concept and it will also motivate me to do more projects. I am also hoping that if anyone reads this and has any projects they would like me to try then 
                        they could let me know and I would give it a try.
                    </p>
